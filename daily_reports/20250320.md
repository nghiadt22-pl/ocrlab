Hi, yesterday I implemented Azure Queue message encoding in the OCR processing workflow. Azure Functions was failing to process uploaded PDF files because the messages in the queue weren't properly Base64-encoded, which caused the Function App to move them to the failsafe queue after multiple failed attempts. Now, the OCR processing can complete and indexed the document content. Here's how you can test it:

# Upload a file
curl -X POST -H "x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID" -H "x-folder-id: YOUR_FOLDER_ID" -F "file=@PATH_TO_YOUR_PDF_FILE" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/upload

# Check processing status
curl -X GET -H "x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/processing-status/YOUR_FILE_ID

# Search for content
curl -X POST -H "x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\": \"YOUR_SEARCH_QUERY\"}" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/query

Example:

curl -X POST -H "x-user-id: test-user" -H "x-folder-id: 1" -F "file=@test_pdfs/1742180735323.pdf" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/upload

# Check processing status
curl -X GET -H "x-user-id: test-user" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/processing-status/1

# Search for content
curl -X POST -H "x-user-id: test-user" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\": \"What percentage of employees have served more than 10 years?\"}" https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/query
