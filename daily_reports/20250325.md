focuses on enhancing the OCR processing functionality to use Azure Document Intelligence for extracting content from PDF documents. The current implementation has the basic queue processing structure, but it needs to be extended to process the extraction results, and store the extracted content appropriately.

1. The system can extract text with formatting preservation
2. Tables are converted to structured data
3. Images are processed with content description
4. Handwritten text is recognized where possible
