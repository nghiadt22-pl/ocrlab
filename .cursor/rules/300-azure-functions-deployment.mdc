# Azure Functions Deployment Commands

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When deploying Azure Functions to Azure
- When testing in deployed environment
- When updating Azure Functions code

## Requirements
- Use the correct deployment command for the OCR Lab project
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before deployment
- Verify deployment success after command execution
- NEVER restart the function app manually during testing as this can disrupt message processing
- Ensure all queue messages are properly Base64 encoded for Azure Functions compatibility

## Deployment Commands

### Primary Deployment Command
```bash
func azure functionapp publish testpl
```

### Deployment Process
1. Navigate to the function_app directory
2. Run the deployment command
3. Verify deployment success
4. Test the deployed functions

## Important Warnings

### Do NOT Restart Function App During Processing
- Never use `func start` or restart the function app when messages are in the queue
- Restarting disrupts message processing and can lead to message loss
- Instead, deploy changes correctly using the proper deployment command

### Queue Message Encoding
- Azure Functions expects queue messages to be Base64 encoded by default
- All messages sent to queues must be properly encoded:
  ```python
  message_json = json.dumps(message)
  message_bytes = message_json.encode('utf-8')
  message_base64 = base64.b64encode(message_bytes).decode('utf-8')
  queue_client.send_message(message_base64)
  ```
- Failure to encode messages will result in them moving to the poison queue

## Examples

<example>
# Deploy Azure Functions to testpl
cd function_app
func azure functionapp publish testpl

# This deploys all functions to the testpl Azure Function App
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Incorrect deployment command
func deploy
# This command doesn't exist and will fail
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Never do this during testing
func start
# This will restart the function app and can disrupt message processing
</example>

## Notes
- The testpl function app is the designated deployment target for the OCR Lab project
- Always test locally before deploying to Azure
- After deployment, test the Azure Queue implementation in the deployed environment
- Check poison queues for any failed message processing
