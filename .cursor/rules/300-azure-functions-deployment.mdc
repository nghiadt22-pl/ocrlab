# Azure Functions Deployment Commands

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When deploying Azure Functions to Azure
- When testing in deployed environment
- When updating Azure Functions code

## Requirements
- Use the correct deployment command for the OCR Lab project
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before deployment
- Verify deployment success after command execution

## Deployment Commands

### Primary Deployment Command
```bash
func azure functionapp publish testpl
```

### Deployment Process
1. Navigate to the function_app directory
2. Run the deployment command
3. Verify deployment success
4. Test the deployed functions

## Examples

<example>
# Deploy Azure Functions to testpl
cd function_app
func azure functionapp publish testpl

# This deploys all functions to the testpl Azure Function App
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Incorrect deployment command
func deploy
# This command doesn't exist and will fail
</example>

## Notes
- The testpl function app is the designated deployment target for the OCR Lab project
- Always test locally before deploying to Azure
- After deployment, test the Azure Queue implementation in the deployed environment
