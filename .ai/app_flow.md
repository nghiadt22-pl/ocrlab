Below is a continuous, step-by-step description of how users move through the application, written in simple language and without using bullet points. Every main page or screen is included so that the entire flow is covered in one place.

When a user first arrives at the application, they see a Sign Up or Login page. The system uses Clerk to handle account registration, so new users can create an account by providing their basic information, while returning users can simply log in. After the user is authenticated for the first time, the system automatically creates a default "Home" folder to help them get started, though they also have the option to add other folders if they want more organization. Behind the scenes, a background process is planned to synchronize the user's information from Clerk into our PostgreSQL database every 15 seconds, ensuring that all user data is consistently available throughout the application without requiring manual intervention.

Upon logging in, the user is taken to the Home page. This page serves as a central place where all folders are listed. Users can click on a folder name to open that folder's view, and inside it they will eventually see any PDF files that have been uploaded. From the Home page, there is a clear "Create Folder" action that takes the user to a simple form to name and confirm the creation of a new folder. Once the folder is made, the user returns to the Home page, now with the new folder included in the list.

When the user clicks on a folder, they enter that folder's detail view. This page shows all PDFs currently uploaded to that specific folder, along with any file statuses. If the folder is new and empty, the user sees a prompt to upload PDF files. Clicking the upload action opens a dialog where the user can select one or more PDFs from their device. Users can upload files as large as 100 MB, and they are free to close this dialog or wait for confirmation that the uploads have been queued for processing. After the user completes the upload, the folder view updates to reflect each file's processing status. While files are being prepared, the system places them into an asynchronous processing queue in Azure Blob Storage so the Python microservice can pick them up for OCR extraction.

The processing step takes place automatically behind the scenes and does not require user intervention. During this time, the user can remain on the same page or navigate back to the Home page or even to other folders. If they check the folder view while processing is still ongoing, they will see a label next to each file indicating that it is "Processing." Once the OCR step finishes, the status changes to "Complete," and the user can click on the file to view a summary, keywords, and any relevant metadata extracted from the document, including the text from tables, images, and any handwriting the OCR is able to detect.

After processing is complete, the user can use the Search page to explore all extracted text in the system. This page provides a simple search bar where the user can type queries. Currently, the system performs basic keyword search, returning relevant text chunks and metadata that match the query terms. The future implementation will enhance this with semantic search capabilities, allowing natural language queries such as "Show me the section on sales data from last quarter," with the application returning the most semantically relevant text chunks and metadata. The user can also access a dedicated REST API if they want to retrieve the same kind of search results programmatically. By sending a POST request with the query text and parameters for how many matches to include, they receive matching document chunks and associated metadata.

The application also provides a Usage Dashboard page. Here, users can track the number of pages they have processed and how many queries they have made so far. The usage metrics come from entries the system stores in Postgres whenever a new page is processed or a search query is performed. If the user is on a paid plan or has pay-as-you-go billing set up, they can see their current usage charges as well. This dashboard also offers a link to the Billing page, where the user can manage their payments via HitPay. If a user is on a free tier, they will still see their usage but may not have any direct billing requirements unless they surpass certain limits.

On any folder detail page, the user can also select a file to Download or Delete. Downloading simply retrieves the original PDF from Azure Blob Storage, while deleting removes the PDF file from storage and deletes all related embeddings and metadata from the system. This ensures that neither the text nor the file remains on the platform.

Finally, an optional API Key Management page may be provided (depending on the exact implementation) to support external developers or integrations. Here, the user can generate or revoke an API key that is used to authenticate search requests. This ensures security and allows authorized access only.

From start to finish, the application flow is straightforward. Users sign up or log in, create or select a folder, upload PDFs, wait for processing, review their documents, and then perform searches. They can check how many pages they have processed or queries they have made on the Usage Dashboard, manage optional billing on the Billing page, and remove files they no longer need. Currently, the system supports basic keyword search, with plans to implement more advanced semantic search capabilities as part of the Azure AI Search integration. These steps cover every page in the system, ensuring clarity for anyone wanting to understand how the application works from beginning to end.
