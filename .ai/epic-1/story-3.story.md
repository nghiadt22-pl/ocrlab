# Epic-1: OCR Lab Implementation
# Story: Clerk User Synchronization

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to automatically sync Clerk users with our PostgreSQL database
**so that** we maintain consistent user records across our authentication system and application database

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story addresses the need to keep our PostgreSQL database in sync with Clerk's user management system. When users sign up, update their profiles, or are removed in Clerk, we need to reflect these changes in our application database to ensure consistency and to support application features that rely on user data.

The implementation uses a TimeTrigger Azure Function that runs every 15 seconds to fetch the latest user data from Clerk and update our PostgreSQL database accordingly.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2

## Tasks

1. - [x] Implement Clerk API Integration
   1. - [x] Add helper function to fetch Clerk API key
   2. - [x] Implement function to fetch users from Clerk API
   3. - [x] Add proper error handling for API requests

2. - [x] Create TimeTrigger Function
   1. - [x] Set up Azure Function with 15-second timer trigger
   2. - [x] Implement user synchronization logic
   3. - [x] Properly extract user data from Clerk's response format
   4. - [x] Handle both new user creation and existing user updates

3. - [x] Update Dependencies
   1. - [x] Add requests library to requirements.txt
   2. - [x] Configure environment variables for Clerk API key

4. - [x] Testing and Validation
   1. - [x] Test the synchronization process
   2. - [x] Validate that users are correctly synchronized
   3. - [x] Ensure proper logging for monitoring and debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The TimeTrigger Azure Function runs every 15 seconds
- [x] The function correctly fetches all users from Clerk API
- [x] New users from Clerk are added to our PostgreSQL database
- [x] Existing users are updated if their information has changed
- [x] The function handles API errors gracefully
- [x] Proper logging is implemented for monitoring and debugging

## Notes

This implementation ensures our PostgreSQL database stays in sync with Clerk's user management system with minimal delay. The 15-second interval provides a balance between timely updates and resource usage.

In a production environment, you may want to consider implementing webhook handlers for real-time synchronization instead of or in addition to timed synchronization.
