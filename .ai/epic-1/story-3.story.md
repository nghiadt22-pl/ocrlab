## Implementation Notes

### Handwriting Extraction Fixes
The handwriting extraction component had several issues that have been fixed:
1. The `create_merged_item` method had a floating-point precision issue when calculating confidence scores, which has been fixed by rounding the confidence score to 2 decimal places.
2. The `extract_handwritten_items_from_words` method was not extracting all handwritten items, which has been fixed by adding a handwritten_words list to store all words before processing.
3. The `merge_handwritten_items` method was not adding the 'merged_count' key to all merged items, which has been fixed by adding this key to single items as well.

### Summary Generation Fixes
The summary generation component had several issues that have been fixed:
1. The word frequency calculation was not correctly normalizing frequencies, which has been fixed by rounding the normalized frequencies to 2 decimal places.
2. The sentence selection was not maintaining the original order of sentences, which has been fixed by using the original sentences list to determine the order.
3. The sentence splitting was not handling punctuation correctly, which has been fixed by removing trailing punctuation from each sentence.
4. The tokenization was not removing all stop words, which has been fixed by adding more stop words to the list, including 'with' and 'some'.

### Vector Search Tests
Comprehensive tests have been added for the vector search functionality:
1. Tests for the VectorDatabase class, including initialization, storing document chunks, and searching documents.
2. Tests for the MockVectorDatabase class, which is used for testing without Azure AI Search.
3. Tests for the TextChunker class, including initialization, chunking text, and chunking documents.
4. Tests for the EmbeddingsGenerator class, including initialization, generating embeddings for single texts, batches of texts, and document chunks.

### Testing Status
We've implemented the fixes for handwriting extraction and summary generation issues, and added tests for vector database integration. However, we've encountered issues with running the tests in the terminal environment. We need to resolve these issues to verify that our fixes are working correctly.

### Next Steps
The next steps are to:
1. Resolve terminal issues to run tests and verify fixes
2. Write additional tests to verify the fixes for handwriting extraction and summary generation
3. Implement API endpoint tests for document upload, processing status, and search
4. Enhance the vector search functionality with filtering, relevance tuning, and hybrid search
5. Implement document processing status tracking in the database
6. Add UI components for summary display and search results

## Testing
We've implemented unit tests for the vector database integration, including tests for the VectorDatabase class, MockVectorDatabase class, TextChunker class, and EmbeddingsGenerator class. However, we've encountered issues with running the tests in the terminal environment, so we haven't been able to verify that our fixes for handwriting extraction and summary generation are working correctly.

## Testing Details

### Testing Approach
We've followed a test-driven development approach for implementing the fixes and new features:

1. **Handwriting Extraction Tests**:
   - Created tests for the `HandwritingExtractor` class, including initialization and extraction of handwritten text
   - Created tests for the `create_merged_item` method to verify it handles floating-point precision correctly
   - Created tests for the `extract_handwritten_items_from_words` method to verify it extracts all handwritten items
   - Created tests for the `merge_handwritten_items` method to verify it adds the 'merged_count' key to all merged items
   - Implemented mock responses for the Document Intelligence client to simulate API responses

2. **Summary Generation Tests**:
   - Created tests for the `SummaryGenerator` class, including initialization and summary generation
   - Created tests for the `_calculate_word_frequencies` method to verify it normalizes frequencies correctly
   - Created tests for the `_select_summary_sentences` method to verify it maintains the original order of sentences
   - Created tests for the `_split_into_sentences` method to verify it handles punctuation correctly
   - Created tests for the `_tokenize` method to verify it removes all stop words
   - Created tests for the `_extract_keywords` method to verify it extracts the most frequent words
   - Created tests for the `_extract_text_from_document` method to verify it extracts text from different document components

3. **Vector Database Tests**:
   - Created tests for the `VectorDatabase` class, including initialization with environment variables and parameters
   - Created tests for the `store_document_chunks` method to verify it correctly stores document chunks
   - Created tests for the `search_documents` method to verify it correctly searches for documents
   - Created tests for the `MockVectorDatabase` class, which is used for testing without Azure AI Search
   - Created tests for the `TextChunker` class, including initialization, chunking text, and chunking documents
   - Created tests for the `EmbeddingsGenerator` class, including initialization, generating embeddings for single texts, batches of texts, and document chunks

### Testing Issues
We've encountered issues with running the tests in the terminal environment. When attempting to run the tests using commands like `python -m pytest tests/test_handwriting_extraction.py -v`, the terminal fails to execute the command. We need to resolve these issues to verify that our fixes are working correctly.

### Testing Plan
Once the terminal issues are resolved, we plan to:
1. Run all tests to verify that our fixes for handwriting extraction and summary generation are working correctly
2. Add additional tests to cover edge cases and improve test coverage
3. Implement API endpoint tests for document upload, processing status, and search
4. Run all tests again to ensure everything is working correctly before proceeding with the next tasks

### Test Results (Pending)
Due to terminal issues, we haven't been able to run the tests and verify the results. We'll update this section once we've resolved the issues and run the tests.

## Next Steps
- Resolve terminal issues to run tests and verify fixes
- Implement user feedback mechanism for search results
- Add support for additional document types (Word, Excel, etc.)
- Enhance summary generation with more advanced NLP techniques
- Implement document comparison functionality
