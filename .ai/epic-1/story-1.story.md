# Epic-1: OCR Lab Implementation
# Story-1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the initial project infrastructure
**so that** we have a solid foundation for implementing the OCR Lab application

## Status

Complete

## Context

This is the first story in the OCR Lab implementation. The project aims to create a web application that performs advanced OCR extraction on PDF documents and stores the extracted data in a vector database for semantic search. This story focuses on setting up the basic infrastructure, including the frontend and backend environments, Azure resources, and database schema.

Based on the project tracker and progress tracking documents, many of the tasks in this story have already been completed, but there are still a few remaining tasks to be done.

  - Verified queue message creation with mock implementation
  - Confirmed logs showing message processing
  - Tested with valid file and user/folder IDs
- **Notes**:

- **Notes**:
  - Deployed endpoint is accessible at https://testpl.azurewebsites.net/api/
  - File was successfully stored in Azure Blob Storage
  - Queue message was successfully created for processing
  - The file metadata was returned with status "processing"

  - All tests passed successfully
- **Notes**:
  - Used Vitest for testing framework
  - Created comprehensive mocks for Azure services (Blob Storage, Queue, Search)

  - Test coverage includes:
    - API endpoint request/response validation
    - File upload and download operations
    - Queue message sending and receiving
    - Document indexing and searching
    - Error handling scenarios
  - Tests are designed to run without actual Azure resources by using mocks

## Dev Notes

- We're using Clerk for authentication as it provides a simple and secure way to handle user authentication and management.
- Azure Blob Storage is being used for storing PDF files, with a container for each user.
- Azure AI Search is configured for vector search with appropriate indexes.
- Azure Document Intelligence will be used for OCR extraction, with a focus on text, tables, images, and handwriting.
- Azure Queue will be used for asynchronous processing of PDF files.
- PostgreSQL is being used for storing metadata and user data.
- We're following a TDD approach for development, writing tests before implementing features.
- **Important**: All backend code must be tested both locally and in the deployed environment before marking tasks as complete.
- **Important**: All frontend components must be tested after implementation and before marking tasks as complete, following the frontend-testing rule.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks:
   - Write tests for API and database
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments
   - Set up logging and monitoring
2. Update this story file as tasks are completed
3. Once all tasks are complete, mark this story as "Complete" and create Story-2 (Core Functionality Development)

    - Backend CI/CD (deploying Azure Functions)
    - Environment setup (creating and configuring development, staging, and production environments)
    - Monitoring setup (configuring Application Insights, Log Analytics, and alerts)
    - Running tests (frontend, backend, and integration tests)
    - Database migrations (handling schema changes with Alembic)
    - Security scanning (identifying vulnerabilities in the codebase)
    - Performance testing (catching performance regressions)
  - Created CI/CD pipeline documentation in `docs/ci_cd_pipeline.md`
