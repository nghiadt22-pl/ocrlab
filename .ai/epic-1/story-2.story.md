## Implementation Notes

### Table Extraction
The table extraction functionality has been implemented in the `TableExtractor` class. This class extracts tables from documents and organizes them into a structured format. It handles row and column spans, preserves table structure, and provides metadata such as confidence scores and bounding boxes.

Key features:
- Extracts tables using Azure Document Intelligence
- Organizes table cells into a 2D array format
- Handles row and column spans
- Provides table metadata (row count, column count, confidence)
- Includes bounding box information for visualization

### Image Extraction
The image extraction functionality has been implemented in the `ImageExtractor` class. This class extracts images from documents using multiple methods to ensure comprehensive coverage. It handles image deduplication, converts image data to appropriate formats, and provides metadata.

Key features:
- Extracts images using multiple methods (document content, visual elements, figures)
- Deduplicates images based on bounding box overlap
- Converts image data to base64 format when available
- Provides image metadata (confidence, page number, bounding box)
- Handles different image formats and sources

### Handwriting Extraction
The handwriting extraction functionality has been implemented in the `HandwritingExtractor` class. This class extracts handwritten text from documents using Azure Document Intelligence. It merges related handwritten items, handles different handwriting styles, and provides metadata.

Key features:
- Extracts handwritten text using multiple methods (styles, lines, words)
- Merges related handwritten items for better readability
- Handles different handwriting styles and formats
- Provides handwriting metadata (confidence, page number, bounding box)
- Includes support for multi-page documents

### Unified Document Analyzer
A comprehensive `DocumentAnalyzer` class has been created to combine all extraction capabilities. This class provides a unified interface for document analysis, allowing clients to extract text, tables, images, and handwriting in a single operation.

Key features:
- Combines all extraction capabilities (text, tables, images, handwriting)
- Creates a unified item list with all extracted content
- Provides configuration options to enable/disable specific extraction types
- Sorts extracted items by page number and position
- Includes comprehensive metadata for all extracted items

### Frontend Integration
The frontend has been updated to handle the new content types. The `transformAzureResults` function in `azure-ai.ts` now handles tables, images, and handwritten text, and the `ExtractedContent` component can display all content types.

## Testing
All implemented components have been tested with sample PDF documents. The tests verify that tables, images, and handwritten text are correctly extracted and formatted.

## Next Steps
- Implement document summary generation
- Set up queue-based processing
- Implement vector database integration
- Create document processing API endpoints
