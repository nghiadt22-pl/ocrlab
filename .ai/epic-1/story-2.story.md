## Implementation Notes

### Table Extraction
The table extraction functionality has been implemented in the `TableExtractor` class. This class extracts tables from documents and organizes them into a structured format. It handles row and column spans, preserves table structure, and provides metadata such as confidence scores and bounding boxes.

Key features:
- Extracts tables using Azure Document Intelligence
- Organizes table cells into a 2D array format
- Handles row and column spans
- Provides table metadata (row count, column count, confidence)
- Includes bounding box information for visualization

### Image Extraction
The image extraction functionality has been implemented in the `ImageExtractor` class. This class extracts images from documents using multiple methods to ensure comprehensive coverage. It handles image deduplication, converts image data to appropriate formats, and provides metadata.

Key features:
- Extracts images using multiple methods (document content, visual elements, figures)
- Deduplicates images based on bounding box overlap
- Converts image data to base64 format when available
- Provides image metadata (confidence, page number, bounding box)
- Handles different image formats and sources

### Handwriting Extraction
The handwriting extraction functionality has been implemented in the `HandwritingExtractor` class. This class extracts handwritten text from documents using Azure Document Intelligence. It merges related handwritten items, handles different handwriting styles, and provides metadata.

Key features:
- Extracts handwritten text using multiple methods (styles, lines, words)
- Merges related handwritten items for better readability
- Handles different handwriting styles and formats
- Provides handwriting metadata (confidence, page number, bounding box)
- Includes support for multi-page documents

### Unified Document Analyzer
A comprehensive `DocumentAnalyzer` class has been created to combine all extraction capabilities. This class provides a unified interface for document analysis, allowing clients to extract text, tables, images, and handwriting in a single operation.

Key features:
- Combines all extraction capabilities (text, tables, images, handwriting)
- Creates a unified item list with all extracted content
- Provides configuration options to enable/disable specific extraction types
- Sorts extracted items by page number and position
- Includes comprehensive metadata for all extracted items

### Document Summary Generation
A `SummaryGenerator` class has been implemented to create summaries from document content. This class uses extractive summarization techniques to identify important sentences and extract relevant keywords.

Key features:
- Generates document summaries using extractive techniques
- Extracts keywords based on frequency and relevance
- Provides configurable summary length
- Integrates with the document analyzer
- Returns structured summary data including keywords

### Vector Database Integration
The vector database integration includes text chunking, embedding generation, and storage in Azure AI Search. The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **TextChunker**: Splits document content into chunks suitable for vectorization
   - Configurable chunk size and overlap
   - Page-based chunking to maintain document structure
   - Handles different content types (text, tables, handwriting)

2. **EmbeddingsGenerator**: Creates vector embeddings for document chunks
   - Integrates with Azure AI services for embedding generation
   - Mock implementation for testing purposes
   - Batch processing to handle large documents

3. **VectorDatabase**: Stores and retrieves document embeddings
   - Integration with Azure AI Search
   - Support for filters and metadata
   - Mock implementation for testing purposes

### Queue-Based Processing
The queue-based processing feature uses Azure Queue Storage to handle asynchronous document processing. The implementation includes:

- Azure Queue trigger function to process documents
- Document download from Blob Storage
- OCR processing using Document Intelligence
- Summary generation and vector storage
- Status updates and error handling

### Document Processing API
The API endpoints for document processing include:

1. **Document Upload**: Handles document upload and initiates processing
   - Stores documents in Blob Storage
   - Creates processing queue message
   - Returns file ID and status information

2. **Processing Status**: Checks the status of document processing
   - Returns processing status and extracted content statistics
   - Includes document summary and metadata
   - Handles error states

3. **Document Search**: Searches for documents using vector search
   - Supports semantic search across document content
   - Returns relevant document chunks and metadata
   - Handles filters and pagination

### Frontend Integration
The frontend has been updated to handle the new content types. The `transformAzureResults` function in `azure-ai.ts` now handles tables, images, and handwritten text, and the `ExtractedContent` component can display all content types.

## Testing
All implemented components have been tested with sample PDF documents. The tests verify that text, tables, images, handwritten text, summaries, and vector search functionality work correctly.

## Next Steps
- Improve summary generation with more advanced NLP techniques
- Enhance vector search with filtering and relevance tuning
- Implement document processing status tracking in database
- Add UI components for summary display and search results
