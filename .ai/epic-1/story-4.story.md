# Epic-1: OCR Lab Implementation
# Story: Azure Document Intelligence Integration

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the OCR extraction functionality using Azure Document Intelligence
**so that** the system can accurately extract text, tables, images, and handwritten content from PDF documents

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on enhancing the OCR processing functionality to use Azure Document Intelligence for extracting content from PDF documents. The current implementation has the basic queue processing structure, but it needs to be extended to connect with Azure Document Intelligence API, process the extraction results, and store the extracted content appropriately.

The implementation will ensure that:
1. The system can extract text with formatting preservation
2. Tables are converted to structured data
3. Images are processed with content description
4. Handwritten text is recognized where possible

This is a core component of the OCR Lab backend, as it powers the main functionality of extracting and making searchable content from PDF documents.

## Estimation

Story Points: 5

## Tasks

1. - [x] Configure Azure Document Intelligence
   1. - [x] Set up Azure Document Intelligence resource
   2. - [x] Add API key and endpoint to environment variables
   3. - [x] Implement client helper function for Document Intelligence API

2. - [x] Enhance OCR Queue Processing
   1. - [x] Update the process_ocr_queue function to use Document Intelligence
   2. - [x] Implement extraction of regular text content
   3. - [x] Implement extraction of tables as structured data
   4. - [x] Implement processing of images with content description
   5. - [x] Implement extraction of handwritten text

3. - [x] Results Processing
   1. - [x] Implement chunking strategy for extracted text
   2. - [x] Store extraction results in database
   3. - [x] Update file status and metadata upon completion

4. - [x] Error Handling and Retry Logic
   1. - [x] Implement proper error handling for API failures
   2. - [x] Add retry mechanism for failed OCR processing
   3. - [x] Ensure file status is updated appropriately on failures

5. - [x] Testing and Validation
   1. - [x] Add unit tests for OCR processing functionality
   2. - [x] Test with different types of PDFs (text, tables, images, handwriting)
   3. - [x] Validate extraction accuracy and performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Azure Document Intelligence is correctly integrated with the OCR processing function
- [x] The system can extract text content from PDF documents
- [x] The system can extract and structure tables from PDF documents
- [x] The system can process images and extract content descriptions
- [x] The system can recognize handwritten text where possible
- [x] Extracted content is properly chunked and stored in the database
- [x] File status is correctly updated throughout the processing workflow
- [x] Proper error handling and retry mechanisms are in place
- [x] The functionality is tested with various PDF types and validated for accuracy

## Notes

This implementation is a critical component of the OCR Lab backend, as it powers the main functionality of the application. The extraction quality will directly impact the usefulness of the semantic search functionality.

For optimal performance, consider implementing parallel processing for multiple files and using appropriate chunking strategies for the extracted content.

The implementation now includes both mock mode testing and real Azure service integration testing to validate accuracy and performance.
