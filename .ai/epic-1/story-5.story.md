# Epic-1: OCR Lab Implementation
# Story: Azure AI Search Integration

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the vector database functionality using Azure AI Search
**so that** the system can perform semantic search on extracted document content

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the vector database functionality using Azure AI Search to enable semantic search capabilities. The OCR extraction functionality implemented in the previous story provides the content, but now we need to build the infrastructure to store document embeddings and enable semantic search.

The Azure Document Intelligence integration is now complete, allowing us to extract text, tables, and image content from PDF documents. The next step is to generate embeddings from this extracted content and store them in Azure AI Search to enable advanced semantic search capabilities.

## Estimation

Story Points: 4

## Tasks

1. - [ ] Configure Azure AI Search
   1. - [ ] Create Azure AI Search resource
   2. - [ ] Configure search index with vector fields
   3. - [ ] Set up API keys and environment variables

2. - [ ] Implement Text Embedding Generation
   1. - [ ] Select and integrate embedding model
   2. - [ ] Implement chunking strategy for optimal embeddings
   3. - [ ] Create embedding generation service

3. - [ ] Integrate with OCR Processing Pipeline
   1. - [ ] Update OCR processing to generate embeddings
   2. - [ ] Index documents in Azure AI Search
   3. - [ ] Store document metadata with embeddings

4. - [ ] Implement Semantic Search API
   1. - [ ] Create search API endpoint
   2. - [ ] Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
   3. - [ ] Implement filtering and pagination
   4. - [ ] Add usage tracking for search queries

5. - [ ] Testing and Validation
   1. - [ ] Test embedding generation
   2. - [ ] Test search relevance and accuracy
   3. - [ ] Benchmark performance
   4. - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Azure AI Search is configured with appropriate index and vector fields
- [ ] Document content is correctly embedded and stored in Azure AI Search
- [ ] Search API returns relevant results for semantic queries
- [ ] Results can be filtered by folder, file, or other metadata
- [ ] Search is performant and scalable
- [ ] Usage tracking records search queries for billing purposes
- [ ] Integration with OCR processing pipeline is seamless
- [ ] API documentation is clear and comprehensive

## Notes

This implementation will enable the core search functionality of OCR Lab, making the extracted document content searchable using natural language queries. It builds upon the OCR extraction functionality implemented in the previous story.

Consider the following aspects:
- Optimal chunking strategy for document content (consider semantic boundaries)
- Efficient embedding generation to minimize costs
- Hybrid search approach to combine keyword and semantic search
- Proper security to ensure users can only search their own documents
