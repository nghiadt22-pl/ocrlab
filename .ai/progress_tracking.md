## Weekly Progress

### Week 1
- **Accomplishments**:
  - Set up basic project structure
  - Configured initial Azure resources
  - Integrated Clerk authentication
  - Created Dashboard page with usage statistics
  - Implemented Folders management page
  - Added navigation between pages
  - Created File management interface within folders
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and icon imports in the file management interface
  - Implemented Search interface with filtering and result display
  - Completed database setup with PostgreSQL
  - Implemented database schema and CRUD operations
  - Implemented folder management endpoints (create, list, delete)
  - Created API documentation for folder management endpoints
  - Enhanced file upload to Azure Blob Storage with status tracking
  - Implemented file management endpoints (list, delete)
  - Created API documentation for file management endpoints
- **Challenges**:
  - Resolving TypeScript errors with shadcn/ui components
  - Configuring Azure resources correctly
  - Setting up database connection with proper authentication
  - Handling file uploads with proper status tracking
- **Next Steps**:
  - Begin OCR processing pipeline
  - Set up Azure Document Intelligence client
  - Implement PDF text extraction
  - Implement queue-based processing

## Notes and Decisions

- **File Upload**: Implemented enhanced file upload with status tracking ("uploading", "uploaded", "processing", "completed", "failed") to provide better user feedback.
- **File Management**: Created endpoints for listing and deleting files with proper validation and error handling.
- **API Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for file management endpoints with request/response formats and examples.
- **API Design**: Implemented RESTful endpoints for folder and file management with proper error handling and validation.
- **Database Design**: Created schema with Users, Folders, Files, and Usage tracking tables. Implemented relationships between tables and added constraints for data integrity.
- **Authentication**: Using Clerk for authentication and user management.
- **Storage**: Using Azure Blob Storage for file storage and Azure AI Search for vector database.
- **UI Framework**: Using shadcn/ui for consistent design and faster development.
- **Backend**: Using Azure Functions for serverless architecture.

## Open Issues

- Need to implement proper error handling in database operations
- Need to add validation for user inputs
- Need to implement proper logging for debugging
- Need to handle file deletion from Azure Blob Storage when deleting file records

## Agile Workflow Compliance

- **PRD Status**: Approved (`.ai/prd.md`)
- **Architecture Status**: Approved (`.ai/arch.md`)
- **Current Story**: In Progress (`.ai/epic-1/story-1.story.md`)
- **TDD Compliance**: All new code will follow TDD principles with at least 80% test coverage
- **Story Updates**: The story file will be updated as tasks are completed
- **Backend Testing**: All backend code must be tested both locally and in the deployed environment before marking tasks as complete
- **Frontend Testing**: All frontend components must be tested after implementation and before marking tasks as complete

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks in Story-1:
   - Write tests for components, API, and database
2. Update the story file as tasks are completed
3. Once Story-1 is complete, create Story-2 (Core Functionality Development)
4. Get approval for Story-2 before proceeding with implementation
