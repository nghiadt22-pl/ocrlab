Below is a recommended backend structure for OCR Lab, highlighting how to organize core components like the database, authentication, and storage. This framework ensures that developers and system administrators understand each service's role and how to integrate them for a smooth end-to-end workflow.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The OCR Lab backend is divided into several core layers:

1. **API Layer** – A REST API that exposes endpoints for file/folder management, search queries, user dashboards, and billing.  
2. **Business Logic & Services** – Services that handle specific tasks such as document ingestion, OCR processing, file status tracking, and usage logging.  
3. **External Integrations** – Services provided by Azure (Blob Storage, Queue, Document Intelligence), Postgres, and authentication providers (Clerk).  
4. **Database & Storage** – A Postgres database for metadata and usage stats, plus Azure Blob Storage for the actual PDF files and Azure AI Search for semantic embeddings.

## 3. Database Setup (Postgres)

Postgres handles user data, file metadata, and usage tracking. It may also store subscription or billing records if Clerk's default data is insufficient.

### 3.1 Tables and Schemas

Common tables include:

- **`users`**: If relying partially on local user data rather than Clerk exclusively, store the user's ID, email, plan type, etc.  
- **`folders`**: Contains folder names, IDs, and references to the owning user.  
- **`files`**: Stores file name, folder ID, status (`queued`, `processing`, `complete`), file size, timestamps, etc.  
- **`usage`**: Logs pages processed, queries made, possibly referencing `users` table for usage-based billing.  
- **`billing`** (optional): Stores records of payments or subscription details.

### 3.2 Database Connection

Use a standard library like `psycopg2` or `asyncpg` in Python (or `pg` in Node). Store connection info (host, port, username, password, database name) in environment variables for security. For instance:
```
DB_HOST=...
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=...
DB_PASSWORD=...
DB_NAME=...
```
Include connection logic in `db/database.py` (Python) or a dedicated Node service. Use migrations (e.g., Alembic for Python or Knex for Node) to handle schema changes over time.

## 4. Authentication

**Clerk** manages sign-up, login, and user sessions. The backend typically verifies user tokens or session data through:

1. **Middleware**  that checks the incoming request headers for a valid authentication token.  
2. **API Key** approach (optional) if you allow external integrations to query the system programmatically.  

Ensure each protected endpoint checks the user's identity (or API key) and confirms they have permissions to access or manipulate a given file or folder. You can store user claims or minimal user metadata in Postgres if your logic requires cross-referencing usage or folder ownership.

## 5. Storage with Azure

1. **Azure Blob Storage** for PDFs  
   - Files are uploaded directly via a signed URL or from the front-end through an authenticated request to your backend, which then pushes them to Blob Storage.  
   - Each file record in Postgres includes a `blob_url` or a reference to its location in the container.  
   - A Python library (`azure-storage-blob`) or a Node equivalent can manage uploads, downloads, and deletions.

2. **Azure Queue** for Asynchronous Processing  
   - When a user uploads a PDF, the system creates a queue message that includes file details (Blob path, user ID).  
   - A separate OCR service (Azure Function or a background worker) polls or triggers on queue messages and performs extraction via Azure Document Intelligence.  

3. **Azure Document Intelligence**  
   - The OCR microservice calls the Azure Document Intelligence APIs, retrieving text, tables, images, and handwriting.  
   - On completion, the service updates the `files` table in Postgres to mark the status as "Complete" and inserts text chunks into the vector DB (Azure AI Search).

4. **Azure AI Search** (Vector DB)  
   - Stores embeddings and chunked text from each processed document.  
   - The search service can be queried by user requests to retrieve the most relevant document excerpts.

---

## 6. Usage Tracking

Once a document is processed or a search query is made, the backend records usage metrics in Postgres:
- **Pages processed**: Summed based on what Azure Document Intelligence reports.  
- **Queries made**: Increment each time a user calls the search endpoint.

If there is a free tier limit, the system checks each user's usage count before allowing additional requests. Pay-as-you-go or subscription-based tiers can be integrated by referencing the user's plan type stored in the database or in Clerk's custom attributes.

---

## 7. Security and Secrets Management

To prevent unauthorized data access or credential leaks:

1. **Environment Variables** store sensitive information (DB passwords, Azure keys, Clerk secrets).  
2. **Key Vaults** or secrets managers (Azure Key Vault) are recommended in production.  
3. **Role-Based Access**: Minimal roles may suffice (e.g., standard user, admin). More granular roles can be added if needed.  
4. **API Rate Limiting**: If usage is high or to prevent abuse, set up rate limiting in your API middleware or gateway.

---

## 8. Deployment Considerations

- **Azure Functions**: Each route or service can be defined as a function. The queue trigger can handle file processing.  
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

---

## 9. Summary

The OCR Lab backend revolves around a clear division of responsibility:

1. **API Layer** for incoming requests and route definitions.  
2. **Business Logic** in dedicated services handling OCR, queue ingestion, search, and usage tracking.  
3. **Data Layer** with Postgres for metadata and usage, Azure Blob for file storage, and Azure AI Search for vector embeddings.  
4. **Authentication** via Clerk tokens or API keys.  
5. **Security** through robust secrets management and environment variables.

By following this structure, each component remains loosely coupled yet integrated for a cohesive system. Maintenance becomes more straightforward, and scaling individual pieces (like the OCR microservice or the search service) is simpler.
