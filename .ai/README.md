## Workflow Overview

The OCR Lab project follows an Agile workflow with the following key components:

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: Defines the project's purpose, problems solved, and task sequence.
2. **Architecture Document (ARCH)**: Outlines the technical architecture, patterns, and decisions.
3. **Epics**: Large, self-contained features. Only one epic can be active at a time.
4. **Stories**: Smaller, implementable work units within an epic. Only one story can be active at a time.
5. **Tasks and Subtasks**: Technical implementation steps with clear completion criteria.

## Workflow Process

1. **PLAN Phase**:
   - Create and refine the PRD
   - Create and refine the Architecture document
   - Get approval for PRD and Architecture
   - Create the first story

2. **ACT Phase**:
   - Implement the approved story
   - Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with at least 80% test coverage
   - Update the story file as tasks are completed
   - Once a story is complete, create the next story

## Current Status

- **PRD Status**: Approved
- **Architecture Status**: Approved
- **Current Epic**: Epic-1: OCR Lab Implementation
- **Current Story**: Story-1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- **Story Status**: In Progress
- **Progress**: 85% complete

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks in Story-1:
   - Create Billing page (optional)
   - Configure Azure Queue for processing jobs
   - Write tests for components, API, and database
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments
   - Set up logging and monitoring
2. Update the story file as tasks are completed
3. Once Story-1 is complete, create Story-2 (Core Functionality Development)
4. Get approval for Story-2 before proceeding with implementation
